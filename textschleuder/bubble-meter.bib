	abstract = {It has been argued that the Internet and social media increase the number of available viewpoints, perspectives, ideas and opinions available, leading to a very diverse pool of information. However, critics have argued that algorithms used by search engines, social networking platforms and other large online intermediaries actually decrease information diversity by forming so-called “filter bubbles”. This may form a serious threat to our democracies. In response to this threat others have developed algorithms and digital tools to combat filter bubbles. This paper first provides examples of different software designs that try to break filter bubbles. Secondly, we show how norms required by two democracy models dominate the tools that are developed to fight the filter bubbles, while norms of other models are completely missing in the tools. The paper in conclusion argues that democracy itself is a contested concept and points to a variety of norms. Designers of diversity enhancing tools must thus be exposed to diverse conceptions of democracy.},

	abstract = {Social media have become a prevalent channel to access information, spread ideas, and influence opinions. However, it has been suggested that social and algorithmic filtering may cause exposure to less diverse points of view. Here we quantitatively measure this kind of social bias at the collective level by mining a massive datasets of web clicks. Our analysis shows that collectively, people access information from a significantly narrower spectrum of sources through social media and email, compared to a search baseline. The significance of this finding for individual exposure is revealed by investigating the relationship between the diversity of information sources experienced by users at both the collective and individual levels in two datasets where individual users can be analyzed—Twitter posts and search logs. There is a strong correlation between collective and individual diversity, supporting the notion that when we use social media we find ourselves inside “social bubbles.” Our results could lead to a deeper understanding of how technology biases our exposure to new information.},

	abstract = {Personalization techniques aim at helping people dealing with the ever growing amount of information by filtering it according to their interests. However, to avoid the information overload, such techniques often create an over-personalization effect, i.e. users are exposed only to the content systems assume they would like. To break this “personalization bubble” we introduce the notion of serendipity as a performance measure for recommendation algorithms. For this, we first identify aspects from the user perspective, which can determine level and type of serendipity desired by users. Then, we propose a user model that can facilitate such user requirements, and enables serendipitous recommendations. The use case for this work focuses on {TV} recommender systems, however the ultimate goal is to explore the transferability of this method to different domains. This paper covers the work done in the first eight months of research and describes the plan for the entire {PhD} trajectory.},

	abstract = {In the recent past, some electoral decisions have gone against the pre-election expectations, what led to greater emphasis on social networking in the creation of filter bubbles. In this article, we examine whether Facebook usage motives, personality traits of Facebook users, and awareness of the filter bubble phenomenon influence whether and how Facebook users take action against filter bubbles. To answer these questions we conducted an online survey with 149 participants in Germany. While we found out that in our sample, the motives for using Facebook and the awareness of the filter bubble have an influence on whether a person consciously takes action against the filter bubble, we found no influence of personality traits. The results show that Facebook users know for the most part that filter bubbles exist, but still do little about them. Therefore it can be concluded that in today's digital age, it is important not only to inform users about the existence of filter bubbles, but also about various possible strategies for dealing with them.},

Although many benefits, recommender systems can put the user inside a filter-bubble given their high focus on similarity measures. This effect tends to limit user experiences, discovering new things, and so on. In the news domain, filter-bubbles are quite critical once they are means of changing people opinions. Therefore we propose a diversification approach to pop the bubble through a representation model based on points of view.},

	abstract = {Social networking sites ({SNSs}) have applied personalized filtering to deal with overwhelmingly irrelevant social data. However, due to the focus of accuracy, the personalized filtering often leads to “the filter bubble” problem where the users can only receive information that matches their pre-stated preferences but fail to be exposed to new topics. Moreover, these {SNSs} are black boxes, providing no transparency for the user about how the filtering mechanism decides what is to be shown in the activity stream. As a result, the user’s usage experience and trust in the system can decline. This paper presents an interactive method to visualize the personalized filtering in {SNSs}. The proposed visualization helps to create awareness, explanation, and control of personalized filtering to alleviate the “filter bubble” problem and increase the users’ trust in the system. Three user evaluations are presented. The results show that users have a good understanding about the filter bubble visualization, and the visualization can increase users’ awareness of the filter bubble, understandability of the filtering mechanism and to a feeling of control over the data stream they are seeing. The intuitiveness of the design is overall good, but a context sensitive help is also preferred. Moreover, the visualization can provide users with better usage experience and increase users’ trust in the system.},

	abstract = {Personalisation algorithms play an important role in catering the information that is relevant to us. The best results are achieved by the algorithms when they monitor the user activity. Most of the algorithms adapt to the users’ personal preferences by filtering out the information that is irrelevant to the user. However, one of the criticisms of this process is that it is leading to informational bubbles called the filter bubbles which is a personal space of content familiar to the user, which would reinforce their confirmational biases or create informational blind spots. This phenomena however is highly debated. In this light, we propose an agent based model study, which tries to verify the implications claimed by the filter bubble theorists and also create an hypothetical environment that does not have a filter bubble and test difference in the information dispersion and opinion formation in both the environments.},
